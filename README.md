# ParserForJobsVacancy
I have created this parser to track vacancies on three different sites: 
This project also contains a primitive Telegram bot for sending the text of vacancies to me, by personal messages.

/**
*For using this parser need created config.ini file with such filds:
*[PARSER]
*par_url_dou   =  /*you need to enter a search link on the site jobs.dou.ua with customized filters*/
*par_url_work  =  /*you need to enter a search link on the site work.ua with customized filters*/
*[BOT]
*bot_url       = "https://api.telegram.org/bot"
*bot_api_token = /*you need to enter a api token your bot*/
*bot_chat_id   = /*you need to enter chat ID where messages from the bot will be sent*/(you can get the ID using the getUpdates bot method, slightly tweaking the index)
